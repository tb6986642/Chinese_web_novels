To scrape specific information from the detail pages of all Chinese novels on the Wuxia World website, we focus on extracting key information such as the title, author, genres, rating, number of chapters, number of reviews, the titles of all the chapters, and details of the reviews.
 
The data for this project is sourced from the official Wuxia World website-https://www.wuxiaworld.com/

The code in this project can also be utilized to analyze book reviews of online literature on similar platforms.
